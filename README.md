# Introduction

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They can work offline, be installed on the user's device, and provide push notifications, among other features. This repository contains my exploration and implementation of PWA features through various codelabs and personal projects.
